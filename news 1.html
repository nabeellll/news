    <P><mark style="color: white;background-color: black;">New Delhi: </mark>The Congress and ally Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) were the most strident strident among the opposition parties to oppose the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), which came up for discussion in the parliamentary standing committee on personnel, public grievances, law and justice Monday, ThePrint has learnt.
        <br>
        <p>While the BharatiyaRashtra Samithi (BRS) <mark>remained</mark> non-committal,the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Eknath Shinde-faction of the Shiv Sena supported the UCC while the Uddhav Thackeray faction wanted the 22nd Law Commission of India to bring out its report first, MPs who attended the parliamentary panel meeting told ThePrint.</p>

    <br>
    <p>While BJP MPs supported the >implementation of UCC, some of them, including parliamentary panel chairman Sushil Kumar Modi, suggested that the northeastern states and tribal areas should be exempted from it. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>“They are governed by the sixth schedule and Article 371 (of the Constitution), which gives them special protection. This should be maintained,” a BJP MP told thePrint, justifying the <br></stand>The panel was hearing the views of the Department of Legal Affairs, Legislative Department and the Law Commission of India on the UCC. Out of the 30 MPs who are members of the parliamentary panel, only 17 MPs from BJP, Congress, BRS, Shiv Sena, BSP, and DMK attended Monday’s meeting, which began with 22nd Law Commission member secretary Khetrabasi Biswal’s hour-long presentation of its 2018 consultation paper, Reform of Family Law.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When MPs asked why the 22nd Law Commission had sought comments on UCC again after it had already done so on its 2018 consultation paper, the official said that at that time, they had only come out with a consultation paper, according to an MP who attended the meeting.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>“The commission informed the MPs that it had not given its <mark style="color: bisque;background-color: black;"> back then. It’s only now that it sought comments from stakeholders on the review</mark> of personal laws,”  the MP told ThePrint.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A second MP who attended the meeting quoted Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) MP Sanjay Raut as insisting that the Law Commission should first submit its report for parties to go through before taking an informed decision. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The BRS is also learnt to have taken this stand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“The BRS MP said that the Law Commission should come out with their report first. There is a lot of clarification that is required. Only after going through the report, will it be possible for the party to take a stand,” the MP told ThePrint. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Parliamentary sources, meanwhile, quoted Congress as saying that the UCC was not required at this stage, instead suggesting that each law be codified and discriminatory provisions weeded out. </p>
    <br>
    <p>On 14 June, the 22nd Law Commission of India had sought the views of religious organisations and the public on the issue of a UCC. The commission has set a 30-day deadline for feedback on the issue.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A Uniform Civil Code (UCC) typically means having a <a href="https://theprint.in/india/law-commission-has-received-8-5-lakh-responses-so-far-on-ucc-chairman-awasthi/1646425/">common law for citizen</a>of the country that is not based on religion. Personal laws and laws related to inheritance, adoption and succession are likely to be covered by a common code.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Implementation of a UCC has been part of successive BJP election manifestos, including during the Karnataka assembly elections in May.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Uttarakhand, which has a BJP government, is already framing its own common code.</p>
